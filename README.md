# Uncertainty visualization papers

This list of papers is to get an idea of how to design visual encodings
for uncertainty and then evaluate them in a large-scale study than is
typically employed.

To this purpose, here is the list of papers divided up into 3 
different categories.  The three categories are: understanding the user, how 
to run mechanical turk studies, and previous proposals for uncertainty 
visualization.

## Decision making under uncertainty

These papers describe the cognitive process of decision making under
uncertainty (i.e. what's going on in people's heads). The idea is to 
get an idea of how people percieve the visualization of uncertainty
and how they interpret it in order to get a better intuition about what
uncertainty visualizations would be good.

## Running turk studies

These papers contain good descriptions of how to run mechanical turk studies
and the issues and gotchas with them.

## Uncertainty visualization

These are papers that present different ways of viewing uncertainty and
some (like the MacEarchen paper) have studies attached which could be helpful
to explain
